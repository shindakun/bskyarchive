# Specification Quality Checklist: Web Interface

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Clarifications Resolved

### Question 1: Session Expiration Policy ✅

**Decision**: Sessions expire after 7 days of inactivity (Option A)

**Rationale**: Balances security with convenience for a locally-hosted tool. Users must re-authenticate weekly if inactive, which is reasonable for a personal archive tool.

**Updated Requirement**: FR-018 now specifies "System MUST persist authentication state across browser sessions with automatic expiration after 7 days of inactivity"

## Notes

- All [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers have been resolved
- All checklist items pass validation ✅
- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- The specification follows constitution principles: local-first architecture, privacy-focused, user control
- Ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` (if additional refinement needed)
