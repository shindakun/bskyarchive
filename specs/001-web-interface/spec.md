# Feature Specification: Web Interface

**Feature Branch**: `001-web-interface`
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I am building a locally hosted web app for archiving Bluesky accounts. It should have a landing page for bluesky login via the bskyoauth package for Go. After login it should have pages for any archival steps, an about page with links to the authors bluesky account and the github repo. It should look sleek and mondern with a dark color scheme."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Authentication & Landing (Priority: P1)

A user visits the local web app for the first time. They see a modern, dark-themed landing page that explains what the tool does and presents a clear login button. When they click login, they are guided through the Bluesky OAuth flow and successfully authenticated, arriving at their personal archive dashboard.

**Why this priority**: Authentication is the gateway to all other functionality. Without the ability to log in, users cannot access any archival features. This is the foundation of the entire web interface.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to the landing page, clicking the login button, completing OAuth flow, and verifying successful redirect to a post-login page. Delivers immediate value by establishing user identity and session.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user visits the landing page for the first time, **When** they view the page, **Then** they see a clear description of the archive tool, a prominent login button, and dark-themed modern styling
2. **Given** a user clicks the login button, **When** the OAuth flow initiates, **Then** they are redirected to Bluesky's authentication page
3. **Given** a user completes Bluesky authentication, **When** they authorize the app, **Then** they are redirected back to the app with an active session
4. **Given** a user has successfully authenticated, **When** they return to the landing page, **Then** they are automatically redirected to their dashboard (already logged in)
5. **Given** a user's session expires, **When** they attempt to access protected pages, **Then** they are redirected to the landing page with a clear message

### User Story 2 - Archive Management Pages (Priority: P2)

An authenticated user wants to manage their Bluesky archive. They can navigate to dedicated pages that show their archival status, initiate new archive operations, view progress of ongoing operations, and browse their archived content. The interface provides clear feedback on what's happening and allows users to control the archival process.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality - the reason users are using the tool. Without archive management pages, users can log in but cannot actually perform or monitor archival operations.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by logging in as an authenticated user, navigating to archive management pages, and verifying all archival controls and status information are displayed and functional.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user navigates to the archive page, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see their current archive status (last sync date, total posts archived, total media archived)
2. **Given** a user has no existing archive, **When** they view the archive page, **Then** they see a clear call-to-action to initiate their first archive
3. **Given** a user initiates an archive operation, **When** the operation runs, **Then** they see real-time progress updates (posts fetched, media downloaded, percentage complete)
4. **Given** an archive operation completes, **When** the user views the archive page, **Then** they see updated statistics and a success message
5. **Given** an archive operation fails, **When** the error occurs, **Then** the user sees a clear error message with guidance on how to resolve the issue
6. **Given** a user has an existing archive, **When** they initiate a sync, **Then** they can choose between full re-sync or incremental update
7. **Given** a user browses their archive, **When** they navigate through archived posts, **Then** they can view posts with all metadata, media, and thread context preserved

### User Story 3 - About Page & External Links (Priority: P3)

A user wants to learn more about the tool, its creator, and the source code. They navigate to an About page that provides project information, links to the author's Bluesky account for support or feedback, and a link to the GitHub repository for those interested in contributing or reviewing the code. The page maintains the same modern, dark aesthetic as the rest of the app.

**Why this priority**: While important for transparency and community building, the About page is not essential for core archival functionality. Users can successfully archive their data without visiting this page.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to the About page and verifying all information is displayed correctly, all external links work properly, and styling is consistent with the rest of the app.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user navigates to the About page, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see a description of the project, its purpose, and key features
2. **Given** the About page displays, **When** the user looks for author information, **Then** they see a clickable link to the author's Bluesky account
3. **Given** the About page displays, **When** the user looks for source code, **Then** they see a clickable link to the GitHub repository
4. **Given** a user clicks the Bluesky link, **When** the link is activated, **Then** it opens the author's Bluesky profile in a new tab
5. **Given** a user clicks the GitHub link, **When** the link is activated, **Then** it opens the repository in a new tab
6. **Given** a user views the About page, **When** they compare it to other pages, **Then** the dark theme and modern styling are consistent

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user denies OAuth authorization during the Bluesky login flow?
- How does the system handle an expired or invalid OAuth token during an active session?
- What happens when a user tries to initiate an archive operation while another operation is already in progress?
- How does the interface behave when the Bluesky API is unavailable or rate-limited?
- What happens when a user navigates directly to a protected page URL without being authenticated?
- How does the system handle extremely large archives (10,000+ posts) in terms of display and pagination?
- What happens when a user closes the browser mid-archive operation?
- How does the interface handle network interruptions during archival operations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

## Assumptions

- Users will access the web app from a local machine (localhost) rather than a public domain
- Users have already installed and configured the archival tool on their local system
- The Bluesky OAuth flow is handled by the bskyoauth package and returns standard OAuth tokens
- Archive operations are initiated by the web interface but executed by backend services
- Users have a modern web browser with JavaScript enabled
- The application will run as a single-user instance (one user per local installation)
- Session management uses secure, HTTP-only cookies or similar browser storage mechanisms
- The web server binds to a configurable local port (default localhost:8080 or similar)
