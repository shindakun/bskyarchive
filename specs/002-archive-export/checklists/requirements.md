# Specification Quality Checklist: Archive Export

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Clarifications Resolved

No clarification questions were needed. The specification is complete with:
- Clear export formats (JSON and CSV)
- Defined media handling (copy to /media subdirectory)
- Explicit date range filtering support
- Comprehensive edge cases identified
- Measurable success criteria for performance and correctness

## Validation Results

### User Stories
- ✅ P1 (JSON Export): Independently testable, delivers core value
- ✅ P2 (CSV Export): Independently testable, delivers accessibility value
- ✅ P3 (Date Filtering): Independently testable, delivers convenience value

### Functional Requirements
- ✅ 18 requirements defined
- ✅ All requirements are clear and testable
- ✅ No implementation details mentioned
- ✅ Export formats, file handling, and validation clearly specified

### Success Criteria
- ✅ 10 measurable outcomes defined
- ✅ Performance benchmarks specified (1,000 posts in <10 seconds)
- ✅ Quality metrics defined (100% parseable, no corruption)
- ✅ All criteria are technology-agnostic

### Edge Cases
- ✅ 9 edge cases identified covering empty archives, large exports, disk space, missing files, Unicode handling, and concurrent operations

## Notes

- All checklist items pass validation ✅
- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- The specification follows constitution principles:
  - **Data privacy**: Exports stay local, no external services
  - **Comprehensive archival**: All metadata and media preserved
  - **Multiple export formats**: JSON (complete) and CSV (accessible)
  - **Efficient operations**: Performance benchmarks defined
- Ready for `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
