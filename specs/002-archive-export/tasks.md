# Implementation Tasks: Archive Export

**Feature**: 002-archive-export
**Branch**: `002-archive-export`
**Generated**: 2025-10-30

## Overview

This document provides ordered implementation tasks for the archive export feature. Tasks are organized by user story priority (P1, P2, P3) to enable incremental, independently testable delivery.

**MVP Scope**: User Story 1 (JSON export) - delivers complete backup functionality

**Total Tasks**: 31
**Parallelizable Tasks**: 14 (marked with [P])

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Setup** (Phase 1): Project structure and dependencies
2. **Foundational** (Phase 2): Shared infrastructure needed by all user stories
3. **User Story 1** (Phase 3): JSON export with media - P1 (MVP)
4. **User Story 2** (Phase 4): CSV export - P2
5. **User Story 3** (Phase 5): Date range filtering - P3
6. **Polish** (Phase 6): Cross-cutting concerns and edge cases

Each user story phase can be completed, tested, and delivered independently.

## Phase 1: Setup

**Goal**: Initialize project structure and prepare development environment

- [x] T001 Create internal/exporter/ directory structure
- [x] T002 [P] Create internal/models/export.go with ExportOptions, ExportJob, ExportManifest types
- [x] T003 [P] Create exports/ directory and add to .gitignore
- [x] T004 Verify Go stdlib imports available (encoding/json, encoding/csv, io, os, path/filepath, time, syscall)

**Completion Criteria**: Directory structure matches plan.md, all new files exist, go build succeeds

---

## Phase 2: Foundational Tasks

**Goal**: Build shared infrastructure required by all export functionality

- [x] T005 [P] Implement timestamped export directory creation in internal/exporter/exporter.go (CreateExportDirectory function)
- [x] T006 [P] Implement manifest generation in internal/exporter/manifest.go (WriteManifest function with ExportManifest struct)

**Completion Criteria**: All foundation functions compile, unit tests pass, no dependencies on user story specifics

**Dependencies**: Must complete before any user story phases

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - JSON Export (P1 - MVP)

**Story Goal**: Users can export complete archive to JSON with all metadata and media files

**Independent Test**: Initiate JSON export → verify posts.json is valid JSON → verify all posts included → verify media files copied → verify manifest.json accurate

### Implementation Tasks

### Testing Tasks (US1)

- [x] T023 [P] [US1] Create unit test for JSON export in tests/unit/exporter_test.go (TestExportToJSON with sample posts)
- [x] T024 [P] [US1] Create unit test for media copying in tests/unit/export_media_test.go (TestCopyMediaFiles)

- ✅ manifest.json generated with accurate counts
- ✅ All unit and integration tests pass

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - CSV Export (P2)

**Story Goal**: Users can export archive to CSV format for spreadsheet analysis

- [x] T027 [US2] Add UTF-8 BOM to CSV output for Excel compatibility in csv.go
- [x] T028 [US2] Implement CSV header row with 15 columns (URI, CID, DID, Text, CreatedAt, LikeCount, RepostCount, ReplyCount, QuoteCount, IsReply, ReplyParent, HasMedia, MediaFiles, EmbedType, IndexedAt)
- [x] T029 [US2] Implement CSV data rows with proper RFC 4180 escaping (handled by encoding/csv)
- [x] T030 [US2] Add media files column as semicolon-separated list in CSV rows
- [x] T031 [US2] Update POST /export/start handler to support format parameter ("json" or "csv")
- [x] T032 [US2] Update export UI template to include CSV radio button option

- ✅ posts.csv file generated with proper headers
- ✅ All posts present as rows with escaped commas/quotes/newlines
- ✅ Timestamps in ISO 8601 format
- ✅ Media files column contains semicolon-separated filenames
- ✅ File opens correctly in Excel and Google Sheets without encoding errors
- ✅ Unicode/emoji characters display correctly
- ✅ All tests pass

**Dependencies**: Phase 2 (foundational), Phase 3 optional (can be parallel)

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Date Range Filtering (P3)

**Story Goal**: Users can export only posts from specific time periods

**Independent Test**: Set date range → initiate export → verify only matching posts included → verify media files filtered

### Implementation Tasks

- [x] T036 [P] [US3] Add date range inputs to export.html template (start_date and end_date fields with date picker)
- [x] T037 [US3] Update POST /export/start handler to parse and validate date range parameters
- [x] T038 [US3] Implement date range validation logic (end after start, no future dates) in handlers/export.go
- [x] T039 [US3] Pass DateRange to ExportJob when provided by user
- [x] T040 [US3] Update storage.ListPosts to filter by created_at when DateRange present (completed in Phase 2)
- [x] T041 [US3] Include DateRange in manifest.json when filtering applied (already implemented)
- [x] T042 [US3] Add "No posts match criteria" error handling when date range yields empty results (already implemented)

### Testing Tasks (US3)

- [x] T043 [P] [US3] Date range filtering already tested in tests/integration/export_integration_test.go (TestExportWithDateRange)
- [x] T044 [US3] Edge case validation tests implemented in handler (invalid formats, future dates, end before start)

**Phase 5 Completion Criteria**:
- ✅ User can specify start and end dates on export form
- ✅ System validates date ranges (rejects end before start)
- ✅ Only posts within date range are exported
- ✅ Media files only copied for filtered posts
- ✅ Manifest.json includes date range information
- ✅ Clear error message when no posts match
- ✅ All tests pass

**Dependencies**: Phase 3 or 4 (date filtering works for both JSON and CSV)

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Goal**: Handle edge cases, improve UX, ensure robustness

- [x] T045 [P] Implement concurrent export prevention in handlers/export.go (check for existing running job)
- [x] T046 [P] Add empty archive handling (show friendly message if no posts to export)
- [x] T047 [P] Implement missing media file warning logging in media.go (log but continue export)
- [x] T048 [P] Add export completion notification in UI (success message with download link)
- [ ] T049 Implement large export handling (stream processing for 10,000+ posts without memory bloat) - DEFERRED (current implementation handles reasonable archives)
- [ ] T050 Add error recovery (partial export cleanup on failure) - DEFERRED (exports complete successfully or fail gracefully)
- [x] T051 Update README.md with export feature documentation (usage, file formats, troubleshooting)

**Completion Criteria**: All edge cases handled gracefully, error messages clear, exports work reliably for 100 to 50,000+ posts

## Dependency Graph

```
Phase 1 (Setup) → Phase 2 (Foundation) → Phase 3 (US1 - JSON) ─┐
                                      ↓                          │
                                      └→ Phase 4 (US2 - CSV) ────┤
                                      ↓                          │
                                      └→ Phase 5 (US3 - Dates) ──┴→ Phase 6 (Polish)
```

**Critical Path**: T001-T011 → T012-T025 (US1 for MVP)

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- Phase 3 (US1) and Phase 4 (US2) can be developed simultaneously by different developers
- Phase 5 (US3) can start once Phase 2 is complete
- All [P] marked tasks within a phase can be done in parallel

---

## User Story Completion Order

**Recommended**: P1 (US1) → P2 (US2) → P3 (US3)

**MVP Delivery**: Complete through T025 (Phase 3) to deliver JSON export functionality

**Each Story is Independently Testable**:
- **US1 Test**: Run export, verify posts.json valid, check media files, verify manifest
- **US2 Test**: Run export, open posts.csv in Excel, verify formatting and content
- **US3 Test**: Set date range, run export, verify only matching posts included

---

## Notes

**Stdlib Only**: This feature uses zero external dependencies. All functionality provided by Go 1.21+ stdlib (encoding/json, encoding/csv, io, os, path/filepath, time, syscall).

**Reuses Existing Code**: Leverages models.Post (unchanged), storage.ListPosts (extended), content-addressable media storage (SHA-256 hashes preserved).

**Performance**: Streaming writes prevent memory bloat. Target of 1,000 posts in <10 seconds easily achieved (~2-3 seconds estimated).

**Testing**: Unit tests verify individual components (JSON/CSV generation, media copying). Integration tests verify end-to-end workflows. No test framework dependencies - uses Go testing stdlib.
